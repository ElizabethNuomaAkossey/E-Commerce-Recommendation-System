# Project Overview 
Recommendation systems personalize user experiences across e-commerce, streaming, social media, and more by analyzing historical data to predict relevant content, products, or services. Businesses rely on these systems to boost engagement, satisfaction, and conversions, but they must balance accuracy, diversity, and scalability while handling large datasets in real time.

This project focuses on building a scalable recommendation system that leverages user behavior data to deliver personalized e-commerce recommendations efficiently.
