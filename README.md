# 1. 📖 Project Overview 
Recommendation systems enhance user experiences across e-commerce, streaming, and social media by analyzing historical data to predict relevant content, products, or services. Businesses depend on these systems to boost engagement, satisfaction, and conversions while balancing accuracy, diversity, and scalability. This project applies data-driven techniques to build a personalized recommendation system that efficiently delivers relevant suggestions based on user behavior.

# 2. 🎯 Objective 
Develop a scalable recommendation system that leverages user interactions to generate personalized suggestions, improve engagement, and optimize business performance. By utilizing historical data and ensuring real-time efficiency, the system will enhance user experience while handling large datasets effectively.

# 3. Project Phases Using the CRISP-DM Methodology
The CRISP-DM framework is a structured approach used to analyze e-commerce data, turning raw information into actionable insights. It guides the process from identifying business challenges to deploying data-driven solutions.

   ## 🛒 Business Understanding

The goal is to enhance e-commerce platforms by providing personalized recommendations that drive user engagement and increase conversion rates. By analyzing implicit feedback data, the system can predict users' interests based on their past interactions.

  ## 📊 Data Understanding

The dataset consists of three files:

**- 🛍️ events.csv :** contains user interactions (views, add-to-carts, transactions).
1️⃣ Events Data (events.csv)

This file logs user interactions with items on the e-commerce platform. It includes:

 * timestamp: When the event occurred

visitorid: A unique identifier for each user

event: The type of interaction (view, addtocart, transaction)

itemid: The unique identifier for the item

**- 🏷️ item_properties_part1.csv & item_properties_part2.csv :** these files describe item attributes. it contains over 20 million rows and 4 columns

**- 📂 category_tree.csv :** describes the product hierarchy. it has two columns. the parentid and the categoryid which also has over 1 million data

  ## 🛠️ Data Preparation

This stage outlines the data preparation steps taken to clean, process, and merge the datasets used in the e-commerce recommendation system. The goal of this stage is to ensure data consistency, remove noise, and create a structured dataset ready for feature engineering.
